## What is Bandicam?

**Bandicam** is a lightweight yet powerful screen-recording and game-capturing tool designed for Windows users who need high-quality video capture with minimal performance loss. Known for its efficient encoding engine and hardware-accelerated support (Intel QuickSync, NVIDIA NVENC, AMD VCE), Bandicam is widely used by gamers, YouTubers, educators, reviewers, and professionals who require smooth, crisp recordings at high resolutions and framerates.

Unlike many recorders that cause lag or stutter during high-load tasks, Bandicam optimizes resources to maintain stable FPS while capturing gameplay, desktop activity, or webcam overlays. With multiple recording modes, advanced compression options, customizable hotkeys, and real-time drawing tools, Bandicam delivers a complete, flexible solution for content creators and power users.
